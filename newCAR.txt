environmentally sound modes transport aspects 1 background private car use grown rapidly last decades number motorised vehicles world grew 75 million 675 million 1950 1990 around 80 vehicles primarily used personal transportation e cars motorcycles1 amount passenger kilometres private car per capita increased 90 4 620 8 710 kms western europe 1970 19901 increasing car use generated various environmental social economic problems environmental problems concern emissions toxic harmful substances among things contribute global warming smog acid precipitation next scarce raw materials energy needed produce use cars extension road infrastructure causes distortion fragmentation natural areas might disrupt natural habitats social level car use threatens urban quality life noisy causes odour annoyance local air pollution yields traffic accidents transport identified main cause environmental noise oecd countries 16 population exposed noise levels transport might severely disturb sleep communication 1998 42 000 people killed traffic accidents european union2 moreover less space available walking cycling playing especially urban areas whereas people car without access cars become disadvantaged socially isolated workplaces shops leisure facilities relocate suit car users3 economic problems car use related decreased accessibility economically important destinations congestion european cities estimated cost 100 billion euro per year projected double next decade3 motorists allowed shift external costs accident costs costs managing environmental nuisance noise maintenance traffic safety society whole problems car use might reduced different ways4 first negative impact per car per kilometre driven may reduced via technological innovations e g increase energy efficiency cars reduce emissions per car kilometre reduce level traffic noise technological solutions appear sufficient manage problems listed effects tend overtaken continuing growth motorised traffic world second new road infrastructure may constructed may reduce congestion environmental social problems likely increase strategy followed third may stimulate people drive times places will also especially effective reduce congestion problems less reduce environmental social problems car use fourth governments may aim reducing level car use e stimulate people use modes transport combine trips travel

explored may open travel public transport frequently use public transport may facilitated stimulated women younger people low income groups singles use car relatively less often men older age groups higher income groups couples families car use evaluated much positively public transport except traffic safety even densely populated netherlands public transport widely available notably respondents evaluated almost car use aspects positively although car use perceived expensive sexy contrast judgements public transport aspects generally negative neutral aside traffic safety strikingly even respondents hardly drive evaluated car use positively travelling public transport nearly every respect car use indeed many individual advantages compared public transport considering individual interests appears public transport can hardly compete car however imply people persuaded travel public transport often instead driving people may choose collective interests e g safeguard environmental qualities quality urban life results study indicate indeed respondents concerned problems caused car use evaluate policies aimed reducing car use legitimate respondents less concerned problems strongly think individual freedom move restricted problem awareness also higher among people use car selectively compared frequent car users furthermore study focused attractiveness cars public transport general may well specific situations travelling public transport attractive compared driving e g train might preferred car long distance travel cities suggests policy makers aim banning people cars completely stimulating people use car selectively travel public transport whenever possible reasonable distinction made various types public transport example netherlands people generally especially dislike travelling bus travelling train evaluated far positively9 might easier persuade people travel train often stimulating travel bus appeared five dimensions underlie attractiveness judgements car use independence convenience ‘fun’ car use control freedom kick status negative aspects car use e travel costs traffic unsafety stress frequent car drivers judge favourably factors hardly drive comparable dimensions underlie judgements attractiveness public transport e independence convenience ‘fun’ public transport freedom control status traffic safety infrequent car users evaluated factors favourably danish study also revealed frequent car users evaluate car use positively many different aspects minority respondents strong positive feelings towards travelling public transport cycling10 interestingly especially car appeared much means transport half danish respondents cultural psychological values hardly connected travelling public transport results suggest car users travel car need also love driving people also prefer drive car psychological cultural meanings11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 motorists can express choice car way use driving car may cause feelings control feelings superiority others moreover many people like drive think driving pleasurable adventurous arousing people also drive like real utilitarian need car practical reason drive19 based correlational data presented can draw conclusions causal relationship attractiveness travel modes actual mode choices people may drive much judge favourably cars may also adjusted opinions travel behaviour hypothesised car use evaluated important respondents personal life society public transport however true frequent car drivers respondents hardly drive think public transport important personal life society car study sandqvist kriström19 also revealed especially frequent car users report car significantly contributes quality life many policy makers think car use can easily reduced car use enhances people s quality life fulfils important societal values based results study may conclude assumption true frequent car users people hardly drive may better quality public transport improved car use reduced will likely improve quality life personal societal significance public transport also environmental urban qualities will probably significantly improve case research address point detail expected frequent car users less concerned problems caused car use infrequent car users also less strongly believe government right reduce car use strongly value individual freedom drive infrequent car drivers results line studies stradling et al 16 nilsson küller12 stradling et al 16 found people value freedom connected car use strongly car contributes identity less willing reduce car use nilsson küller12 reported people emotionally attached car drive car often evaluate transport policies aimed reducing car use less acceptable stimulating public transport use appears easy task public transport seems perceived poor alternative car use especially fervent car users dislike public transport car outperforms public transport various aspects think car much just means transport also represents cultural psychological values e g car symbol freedom independence status symbol driving pleasurable fervent car users car use connected various important values modern society may one main reasons strongly oppose policies aimed reducing car use infrequent car users judge somewhat less positively car less negatively public transport consequently may open use public transport regularly especially also consider many problems caused massive car users however since already use car selectively may able reduce car use even many efforts needed stimulate fervent car use travel public transport view public transport can surely compete private car case policies aimed reducing functional psychological cultural values private cars well increasing performances public transport alternative modes transport aspects next consider problems car use making travel mode choices

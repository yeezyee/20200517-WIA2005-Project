Determinants of Customer Satisfaction of Service Quality  City bus service in Kota Kinabalu  Malaysia
Transportation is thus an integral contributor to one’s QOL as it is the bridge that enables an individual
to visit and patronise local amenities  travel to work and connect with family and friends for example  Increasingly  there have also been calls for a more sustainable transportation system as a result of the more eco friendly and more environmentally conscious psyche of the 21st Century global citizen such as cleaner air  safer roads  more convenient access to destinations and having a plethora of transportation options made available to them  It is thus promoted the physical health  safety and well being of the population  Bunting 2004  
Steg   Gifford  2005  in their research have discovered the negative impact of increasing the number of cars on the road   Bunting  2004  Shuhana Shamsuddin et al  2012  noted that if a society prioritises vehicle for personal use only  this will result in an increase in the demand  for cars  The resultant effect will be widespread traffic congestion  air and noise pollution  an unsociable society and exposing pedestrians and cyclists to danger  Therefore  we need a public transport system that focuses on improving air quality and health  Even though Singapore  Tokyo and Hong Kong are known for their excellent public transport systems  Kenworthy 1995  they are not representative of the state of affairs worldwide as other countries are still facing challenges in attracting members of the public to use public transportation  Sampaio et al  2008  analysed the efficiency of public transport systems for twelve cities in Europe and seven from Brazil and found that nine from Europe and only one from Brazil were found to be efficient 
Somehow the biggest failure of public transport appears to be its inability to attract private car users  Public transport does not meet the current demand and thus forcing residents to opt to use private cars instead  Rakesh   Shweta  2010   Among the reasons commonly cited for the refusal to switch to public transportation are often late or cancelled  dirty and unattractive stations  surly drivers and inadequate provision for people with disabilities  Bunting 2004   Banister  2007  added that the long wait  badly  designed transit interchanges  transit route information that is not easily available  and complicated transit routes are among the top reasons people give when articulating why public transportation is not their primary choice  A report from Schneider et al  2013  stated that respondents felt that the public transport did not always meet the needs of the users 
Kota Kinabalu is the capital state of Sabah  located in the eastern part of Malaysia  which is separated from the mainland by the South China Sea  Kota Kinabalu City has become the main entry point to the islands of Borneo and consequently has become the focal point of all activities such as trade  industry  settlement  tourism and the transportation sector  The total population has reached more than 500  000 at 2013  Department of Statistics  2011  
The Kota Kinabalu Structure Plan indicates that it is the city’s vision to be a Nature Resort and
Maritime City in the year 2030  One of the many objectives is to provide efficient and smooth running of public transport  This effort is boosted by the 2011 2015 strategic plans that include the Master Plan for Public Transport  This plan is to organise a comprehensive and efficient public transport system by taking into account the increase in the number of vehicles per year in line with the population growth  KKCH  2011   The main challenge in achieving this objective is in providing effective and efficient public transport network that is able to entice the population to ditch their private vehicles in favour of public transport options  Kota Kinabalu Structure Plan 2030  2010  
However  previous studies have shown that public transportation in the city of Kota Kinabalu is often associated with its ineffectiveness  Kota Kinabalu City Hall  2007   
The reports found that the ineffectiveness can be categorised into five broad aspects  namely   1  comfort   2  reliability   3  accessibility   4  information and  5  safety 
According to the Sabah Development Corridor Blueprint  2008 2025  2007  the city of Kota Kinabalu needs public transport that is both efficient and effective  Several strategies need to be put in place like comprehensive planning and thoughtful development of public transport systems  The objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of public transport from the customers’ viewpoint  The research on public transport is limited to the use of the minibus and transit bus 
2  Literature review
2 1  ‘Customers’ satisfaction determination
The quality of services provided can be evaluated by the perceptions and expectations of customers  Eboli   Mazulla  2011    Hayes  2008  determine customers’ as  soft index  which are subjective in nature that can be used as an indicator of an effectiveness which is focused on customers’ perceptions because they are the direct users  In the case of more traditional businesses  the difference between operating and production costs and that of sales  the profit margin  is fairly indicative of a particular agency’s managerial effectiveness but the success of service based industries depends largely on the client itself  In other words  it should be customer oriented and meet the customers  needs and desires  As stated by Schiefelbusch   Dienel  2009   the customer is the ultimate judge of quality services  Customers’ perspective is measured using the Customer Satisfaction Survey  CSS   which will assist the authorities in improving the quality of services and increase the number of people using public transport  Through the questionnaire  the authorities will be able to identify all elements of public transport that should be addressed 
2 2  ‘Customers’ perceptions towards the effectiveness of public transportation
Several findings of the effectiveness of public transport have been identified through customers’ perception surveys  Iseki et al  2007  revealed that accessibility and reliability are the top two key factors in evaluating the effectiveness of the services at the bus stop and bus terminal  and they are followed closely by the security factor  The findings also showed that the physical factor of bus stops and bus terminals is not a priority  Eboli and Mazzulla  2007  measured the customers’ satisfaction perception in the context of bus services and found many factors that influence the effectiveness of public transport  The main factors are the physical condition  convenience  comfort and safety of the bus  On the other hand  Abreha  2007  found that accessibility and reliability are key factors that contribute towards the ineffectiveness of public transport  From passenger perception  Veliou  2010  found that the number of passengers increased by increasing the effectiveness of the transportation  Lau  C Y  et al  2003   defined accessibility and mobility as the main factor of satisfaction in usage of public transport  In Malaysia  through the Government Transformation Programme  the Public Transport Roadmap has indicated that reliability and travel time  comfort and convenience  accessibility  interconnections  availability and capacity are the key indicators of an excellent public transport system  Prime Minister’s Department  2010  
2 3  Importance of performance measurement and effectiveness of public transport
 Iles  2005Iles  2005  stated that it was important to get the budget from the federal government  improved and enhanced the public transport system as well as to get information for decision making for the next phase of transportation planning  Carr  1986  provides six indicators that can be used in measuring the effectiveness of a public transportation system  and this includes financial control and keeping the integrity of the system  identifying changes needed for each service  maintaining and improving service quality  controlling sub contractors among others  He also expressed the view that feedback can be obtained from various stakeholders such as the customer  community  bus and transport agencies and bus drivers 
3  Methodology
Respondents were randomly chosen by giving them a form in selected vicinities of Kota Kinabalu City especially at bus stops  on buses  at shopping centres  as well as at government and private institutions  The survey was targeted mostly at people who use public transport  The total sample size was 987  The identified variables were as follows   
  The demographic of the respondent
  The perception of the experience  satisfaction  of using public transport within Kota Kinabalu City
 minibus and transit bus 
The level of satisfaction with regard to public transport services was measured with a four point Likert scale where 1   strongly disagree  2   disagree  3   agree and 4   strongly agree  Respondents were asked to rate the twenty four items in terms of effectiveness on their experiences in having commuted on a minibus and transit bus  The twenty four satisfaction items were gleaned from a literature review and also through a pilot study that reflected the respondents’ experiences and problems faced when commuting via public transport  Descriptive statistics involving mean and standard deviation and Factor analysis were used to analyse a total of 24 parameters that outlined the various statements against which the effectiveness of a public transport system can be graded 
4  Research results
4 1  Satisfaction service attribute quality  Minibus 
Table 1 shows the 24 attributes  which are arranged from the most to least positive experience as indicated by the respondents’ survey results of their experience of the minibus service  Results show that the mean scores range from a low of 1 79 to a high of 2 85  indicating that respondents had a varied perception of all the dimensions of the minibus service attributes  The standard deviation for these satisfaction items ranged from 0 66 to 0 98  The top five attributes ranked highest according to the respondents are  feeling secure at the terminal  convenience fare  low fares  buses that are in good condition  and the availability of nearby bus stops  The bottom five attributes ranked the lowest are  overcrowded buses  feeling unsafe at night  difficulty in carrying goods onto the minibuses  lack of facilities for the elderly and persons with disabilities and the buses not arriving on time 
bus service  This means the level of satisfaction garnered or experienced while commuting on the minibus is best compared to that while taking the transit bus despite the mean score of the transit bus service for 7 statements being higher  Both the minibus and transit bus services share the same mean score for 4 statements  ‘safe during the night’  ‘not crowded’   easy access to bus stop  and ‘cheap fare’  This shows that at least in these four aspects  users have the same experience for both the minibus and transit bus service 
4 4  Analysis factors test for effectiveness of public transportation  Minibus and Transit bus 
Factor analysis is one of the multivariate methods used to analyse the correlation between the variables so that all the variables can be reduced or sorted into groups or same categories  This method is also used to identify critical factors in the overall studied items  Sid and Jakappan  2004   Geetika  2010  use analysis factor to identify the factors that are giving satisfaction to the users of platform railway services in India  Karen and Peter  2007  resulted in the discovery of the key factors for the public transport of from the foreign tourist’s point of view while Popuri et al  2011  has produced six  6  factors using analysis factor to identify patterns of travel and consumers’ behaviour towards the use of public and private transport  Abd Rahim et al  2011  managed to produce six  6  significantly different of the bus service characteristics  The analysis starts by testing the validity of the data analysis with the help of Kaiser Meyer Olkin  KMO  and Barlett’s Test Of Sphericity  The test is intended to find out whether all the analysed data are enough to be factored analysis factor is suitable if KMO value greater than  60  With the KMO value  938 for the minibus and  947 for the transit bus  it shows that the data do not have a multicollinearity problem and the appropriate items are suitable to test its factor analysis  Barlett s Test of Sphericity is used to identify whether the correlation between the items is sufficient in order to factor analysis  The test results are significant  p    05 for both the data for the minibus and transit show that the correlation between the items is appropriate to do factor analysis  Table 4 and 5 below shows the results of KMO test  Bartlett s Test  items involved  loading a factor  eigenvalues  percentage of variance and Cronbach’s alpha values  The factor analysis is performed using principal component analysis and varimax rotation with the objective to test the underlying factor structure of the data whereby items with a factor loading lesser than 0 50 were discarded and items that cross loaded were also uninvolved  To determine the number of selected components only eigenvalues greater than 1 00 are considered  Next  the reading of Cronbach’s alpha values of all variables ranges from 0 837 to 0 919 for a minibus  see table 3  while  for transit bus  Cronbach’s alpha values of all variables ranges from 0 768 to 0 935 
 see table 4   exceeding 0 70  Nunnaly  1978   thus confirming that the measurement of this study is acceptable in reliability  Within minibus users’ perspective  as presented in table 1  from 24 statements  19 items were left to be used for further analysis where there was an item each from accessibility factor i e  ‘bus on time’ and safety factor i e  ‘friendly driver’ while two items from the comfort factor i e  ‘bus schedule available’  and ‘not crowded in a bus’ that were cross loaded with the small coefficients of absolute value below 0 50 were deleted 
4 5  Factor analysis test towards minibus services
Based on factor analysis results  minibus users’ perspective  comfort is the most dominant factors that contributed 40 529 from 53 150 percent of the total variance with eigenvalues 9 727  This factor consists of eight  9  items of effectiveness  The second factor is accessibility  Eigenvalues are 1 564 with a variance contribution is 6 516 percent  This factor contains nine  6  items of effectiveness  The third factor is the safety with four  4  items that contribute to the effectiveness of the total variance 6 102 percent with eigenvalue 1 465 
 results noted that statement ‘facilities in good condition’ had highest loading factor followed by ‘clean bus’  while statement ‘easy to get a bus from home’ fall under factor accessibility and statement ‘feeling safe on a bus’ for the safety factor  both lead the rest of the items to stand as having highest loading value  These are rated by respondents who used minibus as a mode of transportation as detailed in table 4  Factor analysis is also performed for transit bus sample where there were 3 items from comfort factor i e  ‘clean terminal bus stop  easy to carry items in a bus  and  not crowded  while an item from safety factor i e  ‘feeling safe at the terminal  were discarded from a total of 24 items as they were cross loaded with the small coefficients of absolute value below 0 50

4 6  Factor analysis test towards transit bus services
From table 4  transit bus users’ perspective  comfort is the most dominant factors that contributed 46 057 from 58 611 percent of the total variance with eigenvalues 11 054  This factor consists of eleven  11  items of effectiveness  The second factor is comfort  Eigenvalues is 1 591 with a variance contribution is 6 628 percent  This factor contains nine  5  items of effectiveness  The third factor is the safety with four  4  items that contribute to the effectiveness of the total variance 5 927 percent with eigenvalue 1 422  Out of the total 20 factorised items under factor analysis  highest factor loading appears in the statement ‘ bus on time’  loading   0 790   followed by ‘bus info’ with loading   0 769  and ‘short waiting time’  loading   0 731  which were factorised under factor called comfort  see table 4   Further investigation of the study in table 4 revealed that within an accessibility factor  a statement ‘convenient fare’ had uppermost loading value among five factorised items followed by ‘cheap fare’ and ‘easy access

5  Discussion
5 1  Perceptions towards city bus services
5 1 1  Factor 1   Comfort
This factor is the main contributor in affecting people’s perceptions of the effectiveness of both minibus and bus transit service  and it includes the physical condition  the convenience and comfort that experiences while being on the bus or at the terminal  The tables used earlier reveal that the respondents are satisfied with a safety at the bus terminal but do not appreciate the congestion or overloaded buses and lack of facilities for the elderly and disabled  carry items and clean terminal  Soltani et al   2012  in their research in Kuala Lumpur about accessibility for disabled in public transport terminal  found out that there are a lot of improvements needs to be done  and the feeling of unsafe among women travellers is still very high when they are using a public transport  Rohana et al  2012    The current system that allows permits to be given out to individual bus operators has resulted in too many permits being issued and has led to bus operators competing with each other  To get more profits  buses that are managed by bus entrepreneurs with more than 10 years are taking more passengers than they should  Travel will only take place when the bus is overloaded  and they will also choose a route that will give more profits 
5 1 2  Factor 2   Accessibility
The minibus is better in accessibility aspect as according to the respondents such as waiting time  good coverage and bus on time  see figure 1    Its small size enables it to pick up and set down passengers relatively easily  According to Abd Rahim  2004   the advantage of using minibus against the larger bus in its ability to manoeuvre easily reasonable speed due to its size and organisational form  Even though the transit bus has the capacity to accommodate more passengers as compared to the minibus  but the latter that cannot provide optimum frequencies  The average shows that inaccurate itinerary and waiting time are the main problem  As the Final Report  Public Transport Fares In Peninsular Malaysia  the Ministry of Entrepreneur and Cooperative Development  MECD  2008   stated that the main problem of the transit bus is the failure to ensure the accuracy of the time while taking passengers  too much unhealthy competition  overlapping routes  and higher operating costs 
5 1 3  Factor 3   Safety
It shows that feeling safe while inside the bus and feeling safe at night are the major problems for both bus modes  minibus and transit bus   However respondents are satisfied with the level of security during the day  This suggests that the efficiency and discipline of the driver is not the main cause of the lack of safety on public transportation services  but rather the problem arises due to the lack of lighting infrastructure and congestion when boarding the bus 
6  Conclusion
Although some research has been done regarding the effectiveness of public transportation  there are few studies regarding the dispute between the effectiveness of the use of a minibus versus that of a transit
The contribution of this study is to identify the primary components of satisfaction among the users of both a minibus and a transit bus  This study showed that a minibus service is noteworthy in terms of the level of comfort and convenience that it affords its users  Although there is no problem about the frequency of access  the horrendous state of the bus is causing discomfort to users  Bus size and bus design are integral in influencing consumer’s convenience and comfort  For the transit bus  accessibility and reliability are key problems that need to be addressed  Some improvements  especially in the operating system should be reviewed for short term and establishing viable public transport modes or alternatives  e g  trams  light rail transit  LRT  and integrated bus and rail line for the long term planning  This feedback can be utilised as a useful tool for authorities and other agencies involved in helping them plan public transport in the future
